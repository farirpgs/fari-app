# Fari v3.3.0 - The one with groups, skill rolls and Patreon

Hey guys!

First of all, I've launched a new [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fariapp) page for Fari.

If you want to support Fari on a monthly basis, well now you can do it for as low as the price of one coffee per month!

Also, I just released version 3.3.0 [of Fari](http://fari.app/) 🚀

This version includes:

- The ability to group scenes or character sheets together (e.g. by campaigns)
- The ability to roll the dice with a modifier by clicking on a character sheet skill label
- Support for wider resolutions
- Possibility to re-order any field in the character sheet
- A brand new "Notes" field in the character sheet [#145](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/145) 👏 [tgirod](https://github.com/tgirod)
- Russian Localizations [#122](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/122) 👏 [hattivatt](https://github.com/hattivatt)
- Various bug fixes and minor improvements like loosing context when opening the draw area in full screen or character synchronization issues during gameplay.
