# Fate Scene Checklist

During a game, whenever I feel stumped or overwhelmed during a scene, I quickly go down this list and ask the players a few questions. Chances are, I forgot one of these key ingredients.

> ## The Checklist
>
> - What are you trying to achieve here, and why? (PC goal)
> - What does success look like for you? (Success result)
> - What’s at risk if this goes badly? (Failure result)
> - Where are we? Describe it. Interior/exterior, day/night? What do we see, hear, feel, smell/taste?
> - What's dangerous or interesting here? What impedes movement or sight? What can the PCs use? (Situation aspects) Any free invokes?
> - Do we need a map? (2-4 zones)
> - Who else is here? (NPCs) What do they want? What are they doing?
> - Who or what stands between you and your goal? (NPC and/or Obstacle)
> - How will you achieve your goal?
>   - "I'll try to Take Them Out." = Conflict
>   - "I'll try to ** before they **." = Contest
>   - "I'll try to \_\_ this situation." = Challenge

## Goal Ideas (for PCs or NPCs)

Build, Capture, Catch, Change, Convince, Defeat, Defend, Deliver, Destroy, Discover, Escape, Explore, Find, Follow, Gain, Get, Guard, Impress, Kill, Learn, Negotiate, Protect, Reach, Reconcile, Rescue, Save, Sneak, Solve, Start, Steal, Stop, Traverse, Uncover, Win

## Tips

- Ask them what they want. Put trouble in the way.
- End the scene on a disaster, cliffhanger, twist, or intriguing clue: "Now you need to go to [PLACE] in order to [GOAL] or else things will get even worse."
- If you're stumped about the game world, ask the players.
- For inspiration, look at their character sheets. Everything the player put on it is something they want to be part of the game.
- If the story isn't moving forward, add danger. Give them an immediate threat to react to.
